<h3><strong> ROMANIA AND I  </strong></h3>
<p>I AM VERY ATTACHED TO THIS COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING POINTS </p>

<ul>
    <li> <strong> MY PARENTS </strong></li>
    <p> My father and my mother were both born in Romania. 
      They lived all their childhood there. 
      They have known the dictatorship, and have seen the country change and evolve. </p>
    <div> They are very attached to their origins, that is why they decided to make me and my sister, this country, discover us from our youngest age.</div>

    <li> <strong> MY GRANDPARENTS  </strong></li>
    <p> Since my youngest age, I have spent my summers with my grandparents in the geoagiu countryside. 
      My grandparents taught me the language, and thanks to them I express myself fluently in this language. 
      I have learned a lot about culture and I appreciate it very much. </p>
    <div> opened my eyes to the truth, and broke stereotypes. </div>

    <li> <strong> MY COUSIN </strong></li>
    <p> My cousin's name is Raluca. She's from Timisoara. 
      During all these years, she introduced me to urban life. 
      It opened my eyes to the inequalities in this country and allowed me to have a global vision of the lives of the inhabitants. </p>
